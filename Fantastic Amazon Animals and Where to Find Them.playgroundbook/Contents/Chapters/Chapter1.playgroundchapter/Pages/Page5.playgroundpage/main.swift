 # Congratulations, explorer!

 
 We have reached the end of our exploration. I hope you had fun getting to know the Amazon species and meeting them in person!
 
 
 We have an infinite diversity in nature, and today you were able to catalog three fantastic species, which is why you received a badge on your Explorer Card for each one:

 
 The glass frog badge, the piramboia badge and the suindara badge!

 
 Congratulations! Now enjoy your memories while having an Amazonian [Açaí](glossary://acai).
