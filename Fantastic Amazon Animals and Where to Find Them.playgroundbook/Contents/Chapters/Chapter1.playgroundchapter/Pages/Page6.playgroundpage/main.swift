 # Thank You


 We finished our exploration and I hope you had fun getting to know a little of the Amazonian animals with peculiar characteristics. It is just a sample of the variety of creatures that can be found in the Amazon, and I am very happy to be able to show you so much of the biological diversity that we have.


 As a lover of random knowledge and animal curiosities, I hope I have passed on some of that passion to you. Trips can be done in different ways, we are not so easily enabled to do it personally, so there are other options, those that depend on creativity, and I hope you have made this trip with me.


 In personal thanks, I thank Rebeca, Ju and Yasmin, for being with me throughout the creative process and pushing me to finish it, in addition to Yasmin helping me with sound effects and melodies. I also thank Leo and Radija for helping me with bugs that are particularly difficult to solve, which took a lot of time. To the other members of the Academy who were with me throughout the process for insights and the like, as well as our mentors who were present whenever necessary.
