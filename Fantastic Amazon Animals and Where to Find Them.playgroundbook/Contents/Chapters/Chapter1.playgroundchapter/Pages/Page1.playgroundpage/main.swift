 # Welcome to the Jungle!
 
 ## Hey, explorer!

 
 Are you ready for an adventure of discovery?
 
 
 Exploring the world, cataloging information ... This is part of the routine of any explorer.
 
 
 In this adventure we will catalog fantastic and eccentric creatures to show the world its exuberance and importance!

 
 But ... Wait a minute. Were you thinking it was a fantasy world? No, no. I hope not, because it is our planet Earth, since we have a nature as fantastic as that of works of fiction.

 
 We will explore the Amazon, and some of the incredible creatures that live here. Your goal is to use your camera to capture a moment of the creatures and release information about them. Exciting, isn't it?

 
 When you're ready, click the button to start exploring!
