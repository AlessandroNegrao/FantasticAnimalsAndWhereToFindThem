## Project

This project is about amazon animals with eccentricities, and it was created by me for WWDC21's Swift Student Challenge, having been accepted.

You'll discover a little about the animals of the Amazon region that have some eccentric characteristics, while traveling through their habitats and recording the moments in photos. Be quick and enjoy it!
